How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

By showing only the changes, it was easy to see the bug in the code.  It was wide open!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

By showing changes in the long term, you see patterns and can make revisions to previous working code should problems arise as well as plan for future development.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

+:  Easier to see logical changes over time; you contorl when to commit, making version control easier
-:  Can lose large chunks of work if problems arise; forget to commit changes at all

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is for coding with multiple interlinked files in mind, while GDocs is for individual files that may be part of a whole but must be kept seperate.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

These can track the history of a project by showing where and what was changed over time between versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You can always revert any changes made without issue, allowing for more bold leaps in code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Manage my code in an easy and efficient way.

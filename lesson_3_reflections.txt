When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

In order to save work instead of a catastrophic failure, as well as easier sharing access to others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Bugs might be introduced as well as making unwanted changes to your branch.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a GH clone of a repo already on GH.  A clone is a copy on your local WD (technically also on your GH station).  A branch is a change in the code not necc the master.  Fork repos, clone to modify (usually), and branch to isolate changes from the master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

So you can see and make changes to the most recent repo w/o internet.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Using G-Docs/Drive, it would be more difficult to track changes and features over time.  Nothing would be easier besides barrier to entry.
